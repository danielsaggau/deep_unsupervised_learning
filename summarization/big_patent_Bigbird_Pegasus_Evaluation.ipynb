The coiled marker does not present any mechanical resistance to the change of shape. after insertion through a needle, the marker is largely straight. when the organ changes in shape, either under the influence of the treatment, or under natural growth or stresses, the flexible markers will take a curved shape. it has been experienced that the coiled markers grip the organ they arc inserted into, and follow the longitudinal change of shape. one can therefore follow the change of shape and relative position of markers for following increase in size and change of shape of the organ.\n",

The base and the lid each have a wall surrounding the periphery of the base and the lid each have grill veins disposed at a distance from one another. The lid grill veins are sized and spaced apart such that the lid grill veins rest in an interlocking position with the base grill veins when the lid is placed in a closing position onto the base for nonuse or storing purposes.

            "An auto- injector comprising a reusable engine and a disposable packaged syringe. The reusable engine comprises a case and a gas spring arranged in the case. The gas spring comprises a cylinder and a piston arranged to reciprocate in the cylinder and seal against the cylinder walls. A high pressure cavity is defined between the distal end of the cylinder and the piston. The piston is arranged at a distal end of a plunger. The cylinder may be translated in longitudinal direction in the case. A latch is provided for preventing this longitudinal motion in the case.\n",
            "The invention relates to a kit comprising an endoprosthesis shaft, a proximal centering and/or sealing element and a spacer element. According to the invention, the spacer element is arranged between the endoprosthesis shaft and the proximal centering and/or sealing element.\n"
